A fatal error was encountered. The library 'hostpolicy.dll' required to execute the application was not found in 'G:\Thuan\Visual Studio\UniDi\UniDi.API\bin\Debug\net6.0\'.
Failed to run as a self-contained app.
  - The application was run as a self-contained app because 'G:\Thuan\Visual Studio\UniDi\UniDi.API\bin\Debug\net6.0\UniDi.API.runtimeconfig.json' was not found.
  - If this should be a framework-dependent app, add the 'G:\Thuan\Visual Studio\UniDi\UniDi.API\bin\Debug\net6.0\UniDi.API.runtimeconfig.json' file and specify the appropriate framework.
